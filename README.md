![Test Image 4](https://github.com/TomasMoratoPerezPorro/efmrApp/blob/master/Composicio_MOSTRA_EFMR_APP.jpg)

This app is a mobile version for a local newspaper. This newspaper uses Wordpress as a CMS for its webapage.
The project is based on the full design of the app and the development process.

We've used UX and UCD techniques for the design and Figma for the prototype.

The app uses React-Native and connects to the wordpress API for loading all the contents.
